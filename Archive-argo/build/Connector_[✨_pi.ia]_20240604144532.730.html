Here is an example of how you might implement the `connector.js` component to connect your application to the client's website using the provided example URL and Groq SDK:

```
// connector.js

import { groq } from 'groq-sdk';

const connector = {
  async connect() {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://argosok.shop/index/my/msg');
      const msg = await response.json();

      // Use the Groq SDK to query the data
      const messages = groq`
        *[_type == 'message'] {
          _id,
          text,
          timestamp
        }
      `(msg);

      console.log('Connected to client website and fetched messages:', messages);
      return messages;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error connecting to client website or fetching messages:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
};

export default connector;
```

This example code exports a `connector` object with a `connect` method that fetches data from the provided URL and uses the Groq SDK to query that data. The `connect` method returns the queried data as an array of messages.

You can use this `connector` object in your application by importing it and calling the `connect` method, like so:

```
import connector from './connector';

connector.connect().then(messages => {
  console.log('Fetched messages:', messages);
  // Do something with the messages
});
```

Note that this is just an example and may need to be adapted to fit your specific use case. You should also handle any errors that may occur during the fetch or query process.
