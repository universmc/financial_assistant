Here is an example of how you could implement the `connector.js` component using the `groq-sdk` to fetch data from the provided URL and store it in a `messages` variable:

```
import groq from 'groq-sdk';

const connector = () => {
  const fetchMessages = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://argosok.shop/index/my/msg');
    const msg = await response.json();
    return msg;
  };

  let messages = [];

  const initialize = async () => {
    messages = await fetchMessages();
  };

  const getMessages = () => {
    return messages;
  };

  return {
    initialize,
    getMessages,
  };
};

export default connector;
```

This code exports a function called `connector` which returns an object with two methods:

* `initialize`: This method is called when the component is first created. It makes a request to the provided URL and stores the response in the `messages` variable.
* `getMessages`: This method returns the current value of the `messages` variable.

You can use this component in your application by importing it and calling the `initialize` method to fetch the data and store it in the `messages` variable. Then, you can call the `getMessages` method to retrieve the data from the `messages` variable.

Please note that this is just an example and may need to be adapted to fit your specific use case.
